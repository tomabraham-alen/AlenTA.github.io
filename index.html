						<h2>Vice President, HADES Project <br> Oct 2022 - present <br /> </h2>
						<p align="justify"> I joined the HADES Project in October 2022 as one of
							the project managers. The vision of the club is to produce 
							a hydrogen based Blended Wing Body (BWB). The sustainability aspect 
							of the project is what mainly caught my attention.
							The work was envisioned to
							complete in three stages; firstly a 5kg single motor BWB followed
							by a 25kg model based on DEP and finally a model swich into
							hydrogen. Even though he project was founded
							in 2020, it was still in its infancy when it was handed 
							over to current team. The ambition of the project was 
							very high for the economic and technical backing it had.
							Knowing the gravity of the responsibility, I didn't have
							to think twice before saying yes to take a role with big
							responsibility and accountability. This was the right
							opportunity to continue my exposure to lead roles working
							in big teams.
						</p>
						<p align="justify"> In the year 2023, I was elected as the Vice President of
							the club. Even though the weight on my shoulders were on
							the rise, the experience and positive outcomes out of it
							were invaluable. We were able to succesfully take the club
							to its farthest progress ever since its conception by completing
							the design and analysis of the first stage and is currently 
							scheduled for manufacturing. We are hoping to do test flights
							by November 2023 mid. The enhanced presence of the club this 
							year was recognised by Dassault aviation upon an invitation to 
							their stands at the Paris Air Show 2023.

						<h2>Master's thesis, ISAE-SUPAERO <br> June 2022 - present <br /> </h2>
						<p align="justify"> The research project aims to deal with high dimensional problems
							within the scope of reliability analysis. The major actor in the
							flow of project is Python, specifically the OpenTurns package. We
							aim to incorporate adaptive Kriging with Importance Sampling to 
							create an efficient Kriging model. It is approached step by step
							by initially working on a benchmark problem of cantilever beam 
							deflection. The benchmark is the default deflection problem given 
							on OpenTurns documentation. We were able to check and reporduce
							reliable results by the Adaptive Kriging model based on Monte Carlo 
							Simulation (AK-MCS) in comparison with the results from OpenTurns
							which is based on Importance Sampling, thus confirming the validity 
							of the AK-MCS model. Next step is to enhance the model by creating 
							an AK-IS model followed by the most challenging part of the project
							that is to accommodate high dimensional scenarios in the model which
							is still considered an open problem thus giving us the scope of 
							novelty in the work. The below work is a result of combined 
							synergic work with my colleague Gokulnath R, and our mentors 
							Christian Gogu (Prof, ISAE-SUPAERO) & Gabriele Capasso (Airbus).

						<h2>Summer Internship, ISAE-SUPAERO <br>June 2023 (2 months)<br /></h2>
						<p align="justify"> With growing interest in exploring sustainability 
							options for the aviation of the future, I applied to work on a 
							project which studies the feasibility of a solar powered light 
							aircraft falling under CS-23. The work was carried out by parallely
							working on constraint analysis for the defined TLARs and doing extensive
							literature survey on solar PV technology. Topics varying from basic types of panels
							to schockley queisser limit to future scope of peak panel efficiency
							were studied. The solar panel tech scenario applied on the constraint
							analysis of the aircraft was the most optimistic scenario after 
							literature studies. The analysis was done and conclusions were drawn 
							which led us to analyse the exploitation of solar power in isolated
							flight regimes and also took us to the possibility of a flying wing.

						<h2>System Engineer, Infosys pvt Ltd.<br>March 2021 (1year)<br /></h2>
						<p align="justify"> The one year stint at the IT giants from India, Infosys
							was my first full time professional experience. Being completely
							outside my expertise was indeed a challenge. However, the practical
							lessons this period gave me was numerous. The real corporate exposure
							was very important as it helped me grow as an individual and as a 
							professional team player. My project was the Daimler project of
							Infosys, which was the biggest contract of the company at that time.
							Moreover, the intensive training by Infosys in the beginning of the contract
							was equally rewarding as I was able to experience other coding languages
							likde Java and SQL.

						<h2>Summer Internship, Air India Engineering services<br>July 2019 (1 month)<br /></h2>
						<p align="justify">The internship at Air India was one of the moments of my
							life that helped me reconfirm my passion in aeronautical engineering.
							I was part of a team of students assigned to the Maintenance, Repair &
							Overhaul section (MRO) at the Components Overhaul Division (COD). I got
							up close exposure to various activities in the aircraft hangar. Some of them
							are overhaul of the aircraft tyres of both the main and nose landing gears,
							overhaul of the brake system, and various forms of NDT testing. I was 
							also fortunate enough to see how the reporting and documentation is done
							in the maintenance center which taught me about the value of time in 
							the industry.

						<H2>SAE BAJA competition, India<br> 2019<br /></H2>
						<p align="justify">The SAE Baja is a prestigious competition held each 
							year world wide where the objective is to construct an all terrain
							vehicle from scratch. It is usually a part of the legacy and reputation
							of the university itself. The work spanned almost an entire year 
							where a highly motivated student team work day in day out from
							design, analysis to manufacturing. I was initially a part of the main 
							design team to design the rollcage of the buggy. Soon I was also part
							of analyses of various components like the main rollcage, or individual
							subcomponents like the engine subframe, etc.. This period gave me 
							higher proficiency in softwares like Solidworks and ANSYS.
						</p>
						<p align="justify">Moreover, once the manufacturing phase started, I
							was able to experience a whole different level of skills. Most important
							of all being efficient team management as the team was very big. The 
							experience also augmented my capability to work under pressure.

						<h2>SAE Aerodesign competition, India<br>2019<br /></h2>
						<p align="justify"> The SAE Aerodesign competition is yet another 
							high intensity competition where the objective is to build a radio
							controlled airplane. All throughout my four years of undergraduate,
							I was rediscovering my interest in Aeronautics. Enrolling to 
							this competition is a testimony to that. It was held during the same 
							period as the SAE BAJA competition both of which are very intense level
							competitions. It was a period that really made the multitasker in me
							come out. Softwares like Solidworks and XFLR5 were used extensively.

						<h2>Undergraduate final project, India<br>2019<br /></h2>
						<p align="justify"> In the quest to do something impactful, I decided
							to join one of my professors (Prof Bobby Paul) in the design and analysis
							of a novel low cost wheelchair. The initial plan was to construct the 
							wheelchair and provide some samples to the handicapped which we had
							noted. Even though certain adversities did not allow me to actualise this dream,
							I was able to learn something new which was ergonomics analysis using RULA.
							It was an interesting experience with completely new concepts even though 
							the usual works of design and analysis was still being carried out.

						<h2>Vice President, HADES Project<br>ISAE-SUPAERO, Ongoing<br /></h2>
						<P align="justify"> I was initially one of the project managers who got elected 
							to this post. The opportunity is very important for me as
							it helps me improve my team management skills for the first time
							in a cross cultural environment. The team is very diverse
							with colleagues from different parts of the world like
							Spain, India, Italy, Portugal to name a few. I discovered

						<h2>Assitant Project Manager, Technical Fest<br>Undergraduate, 2018<br /></h2>
						<P align="justify"> This one of the most intense managerial experiences I have
							ever come across. The event was called Mechnius, which is
							the national level tech fest of the department of Mechanical Engineering.
							The major challenge was conducting this in the wake of the
							2018 mega floods in Kerala, my home state. There was also 
							the pressure to coordinate people amidst this adversity
							alon with the pressure of outperforming or at least match 
							the revenue and performance of the previous year. With 
							meticulous planning and articulate human management, we were
							able to pull off the highest revenue in the history of
							the fest, the credit to which I would like to give to the
							wonderful team I had. This period raised my ability to 
							work under pressure to new highs.
						</P>

						<h2>Vice President, ARMS (Association of Mechanical Engineering students)<br>Undergraduate, 2018-2019<br /></h2>
						<p align="justify"> The one year stint serving as the Vice President of
							the most vibrant group of people in the campus was
							exhilarating to say the least. It had challenges of a very
							different nature as the group I was the VP of was basically
							a big group of students who are my friends and colleagues 
							as well. It showcased to me the difficulties related to 
							management of a very big group when there is no hierarchial
							structure but on the contrary, it showed how the group can 
							be extremely powerful and results driven if the non hierarchial
							management turns out to be a success. Gratefully my team had
							a good rapport with the most of the group. Just like other
							experiences this too taught me a different aspect of 
							being an efficient team player and stepping up as a leader
							when the situation demands.
